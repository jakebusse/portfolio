Personal portfolio site

## About this Project
This portfolio site is currently being continuously developed as I learn and fine-tune my skills in React as well as other necessary web components. Once I obtain a firm understanding of the technologies that help support this site and I am satisfied with its appearance and functionality it will replace my current personal website found at www.jakebusse.net. This could be considered a beta version of my updated portfolio. There is currently no firm timeline on the development of this project as progress will be made as I have availability in my schedule. This repository is public so that others can join along on this ride. Feel free to fork and customize if you like what you see. Once a minimally viable, stable version is created it will be hosted and linked to from my current site as a 'beta' version. Updates can be found here as well.
